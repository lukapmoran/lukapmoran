# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Luka

* **Mechanical Engineer by training**
* **Medical student**
* **Self-taught Software Developer**
  * ~13 YoE (non-professional)
  * 1 software internship (professional)

Iâ€™m drawn to education-focused projects because learning is such a constant in my life. At my core, Iâ€™ve always been powered by curiosity, especially for things wrapped in mystery. Whether itâ€™s the hidden dance of molecules in pharmacology, the invisible flow of electrons in software, or the source code of life in genetics, Iâ€™m fascinated by systems whose inner workings arenâ€™t immediately obvious. Iâ€™m equally driven by growth, both in myself and in what I export to the world. I believe in the power of small, deliberate, and measurable improvements as the most reliable path to lasting success. More importantly, they're also the part I enjoy most, since the journey matters more to me than the destination. 

I approach challenges with a balance of curiosity and pragmatismâ€”measured enough to weigh the trade-offs, but stubborn enough to push through when it matters. Sometimes that means diving in despite the doubts, other times it means walking away. For me, itâ€™s about pushing limits where they count, and building things that last.
