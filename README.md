# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Luka

**Mechanical engineer by training Â· Current medical student Â· Self-taught software developer (~13 casual YoE)**

I tend to focus on education-related projects because I do so much of it myself. I enjoy the intersection of engineering, medicine, and technologyâ€”always pushing limits and asking, "Well, I'll at least try." I believe in making things work, automating wherever possible, and designing robust systems with user experience and maintainability in mind.
